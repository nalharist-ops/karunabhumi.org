                    Last month I also finished playing Clair Obscur Expedition 33, what an interesting twist for the modern turn-based RPG combat system.
                    And don't tell me about Its story, telling it is a masterpiece would be an understatement. The OST is also a banger through and through. Lorien Testard is such a good composer.
